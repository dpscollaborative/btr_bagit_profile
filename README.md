# Beyond the Repository BagIt Profile

## Background
This BagIt Profile is the product of “Beyond the Repository,” a two-year IMLS National Digital Platform Project grant (LG-70-18-0168-18). In 2019, the grant brought together a group of more than twenty digital preservation experts, practitioners, and service providers to collaboratively develop tools to increase interoperability between local repository systems and distributed digital preservation (DDP) networks. This work included a toolkit to assist digital preservation practitioners in selecting materials for DDP systems, and this BagIt profile, which was designed to reduce the number of workarounds required to integrate different parts of a digital preservation workflow and promote linkages between systems. In 2020, the profile will be implemented by DSpace, Fedora, Academic Preservation Trust, and the LOCKSS project. The Beyond the Repository grant team hopes that other organizations and services will implement this profile, and continue to bridge gaps between local repository and DDP infrastructure.
